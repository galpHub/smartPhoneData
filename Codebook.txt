The dataset contains a data.frame with window means and window standard deviation of various smartphone accelerometer 
measurements. The raw measurments were obtained from the url: 
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
Remark: The dataset presented here was obtained by performing a specific set of reproducible computations as per the
"run_analysis.R" script on this raw data.

The variable names were changed from the names in the raw data set in order to provide a more descriptive meaning
of the measurements. Note that the FT prefix indicates a fourier transformed signal. The names are given in a 
prefix-suffix format. The prefixes are

"LinearAcceleration",
"GravityAcceleration",
"LinearJerk",
"AngularVelocity",
"AngularJerk",
"LinearAcceleration_Magnitude",
"Gravity_AccelerationMagnitude",
"Linear_JerkMagnitude",
"AngularVelocity_Magnitude",
"AngularVelocity_JerkMagnitude",
"FT_LinearAcceleration",
"FT_LinearJerk",
"FT_AngularVelocity",
"FT_LinearAcceleration_Magnitude",
"FT_Linear_JerkMagnitude",
"FT_AngularVelocity_Magnitude",
"FT_AngularVelocity_JerkMagnitude"

and suffixes are a combination using one of -mean() or -std() and one of -X,-Y, or -Z. The prefix
indicates the measured quantity and the suffix indicates wether we're recording the window means 
or the window stardard deviations and in addition, when the variable a vector quantity,
what direction is meant.

For refference, the original variable names are listed bellow in the same order as the corresponding 
prefixes above.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

That is to say that where before we would see a variable named tBodyAcc-mean()-X (which records for each window 
the mean linear acceleration) we would now see the name LinearAcceleration-mean()-X. The choice of names comes from 
"features_info.txt" document accompanying the data set where it is suggested that 'Acc' stands for acceleration 'Gyro' 
for gyroscopic or 'turning' (thus the choice of the word angular) and 'Mag' for magnitude. The use of the word 'Linear' 
is used to distinguish this component of the acceleration from the angular component. The prefix FT is short for 
fourier-transformed.
